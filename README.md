# ICIP 2017 Proceedings USB

## Interface
  An Author Index and a Session Index are included in HTML format on this USB
  to aide you in finding particular conference papers.  Start by opening the file
  'ICIP2017.html' which is located in the root directory.  From this page,
  you can link to the author index, the session index, the people involved,
  and this help file.
	
  There are many different PDF viewers available, however
  Adobe Acrobat Reader is typically viewed as the standard by which others are judged.
  Please be aware that not all viewers will display a valid/certified PDF correctly. 
  Acrobat Reader by Adobe is recommended for viewing conference proceedings without errors.
  
## Full Text Search
  If you have Adobe Acrobat Reader version 6 or later, you can perform a
  full-text search for terms found in ICIP 2017 proceedings papers. To
  perform a full text search, open the file named 'Full_Text_Search.pdf' and
  follow the instructions found within that file.

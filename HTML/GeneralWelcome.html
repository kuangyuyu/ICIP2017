<p>On behalf of the ICIP 2017 Organizing Committee, we would like to welcome you to the 24th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP) in Beijing, China!</p>

<p>The IEEE ICIP is one of the flagship conferences of the IEEE Signal Processing Society (SPS), held annually since 1994 in a number of locations around the world. Over the past two decades, ICIP has become the premier forum for researchers, practitioners, educators, and students to share, learn, and advance the state-of-the-art in the areas of image/video processing, image/video communications, computer vision, computational imaging, and visual technologies based applications. ICIP 2017 is the first edition of ICIP being held in mainland China, marking a milestone of a strong multi-year effort by the SPS to strengthen membership development and engagement in China.</p>

<p>The city of Beijing has a long and rich history of more than 3,000 years.  Beijing is the capital of five ancient Chinese dynasties, and also the site of the 2008 modern Olympic Games. The city attracts more than 280 million domestic and oversea visitors a year, with top attractions including the golden-roof royal palaces and temples of the Forbidden City, Yonghe Palace, and Temple of Heaven; the traditional Chinese styled gardens and royal retreats, such as the Summer Palace; the breathtaking Great Walls with multiple access points, most notably the Badaling, Juyongguan, Mutianyu, and Jinshanling; the unique “Hutong” alley tours to immerse into the traditional residential life; and the  traditional and modern theaters. Known as the “Golden Autumn,” September is generally the best season to visit Beijing, with comfortable weather conditions. If your schedule permits, staff from our local event services are more than happy to provide sightseeing recommendations for you to experience Beijing, a city with profound historical and cultural significance and home of seven UNESCO World Heritage sites and thousands of historic and cultural relics.</p>

<p>The conference venue, the China National Convention Center (CNCC), is located in the heart of the Olympic Park and just steps away from the iconic Bird Nest and Water Cube from the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. CNCC is one of the largest convention center in Asia with state-of-the-art facilities. In addition, we have developed a synergy with the SPS Signal and Data Science Forum (SIDAS 2017 that evolved from the ChinaSIP outreach effort), which will be held back-to-back with our ICIP on the beautiful campus of Tsinghua University, next to Beijing’s Silicon Valley, on the weekend preceding the main conference.</p>

<p>The technical program of ICIP 2017 has been assembled under the leadership of Technical Program Co-Chairs: Jiebo Luo, Wenjun Zeng, and Yu-Jin Zhang.  79 area chairs most of whom are experts and active participants of the SPS’s Image, Video and Multi-dimensional Signal Processing Technical Committee (IVMSP TC), the Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP) TC, the Bio Imaging and Signal Processing (BISP) TC, the Information Forensics and Security (IFS) TC, and the Computational Imaging Special Interest Group played vital roles in coordinating the paper review process.  Over 1200 reviewers in the community have been called upon to provide expert opinions on more than 2000 paper submissions.  The Technical Chairs’ Message together with the color-coded Program-at-a-Glance provide a comprehensive overview of the technical program. </p>

<p>In order to nurture the career development of the future generation of image/video processing researchers and professionals, we are hosting a Doctoral Student Symposium coordinated and chaired by Dong Xu on Tuesday morning, September 19th, followed by a SPS-sponsored Student Career Luncheon.  24 doctoral students will present an overview poster of their research. We encourage you to participate in the symposium, and provide feedback and support to them regarding the next steps in their careers. </p>

<p>Significant advances in visual processing would not be possible if without strong participation from both academia and industry.  ICIP 2017 is fortunate to receive strong support from industry worldwide as well as academic and research organizations in China in the form of sponsorships, exhibitions and hands-on workshops.  We appreciate the generous funds provided by sponsors to help us enrich the ICIP 2017 program and enhance the attendees’ experiences.</p>

<p>The ICIP 2017 social program includes a welcome reception on Sunday evening, September 17th, and an awards banquet on Tuesday evening, September 19th.  In addition to enjoying a range of food flavors of the East and West, attendees will also experience cultural demonstrations and performances of traditional visual and performing arts, showcasing the thousands of years’ of Chinese cultural heritage.</p>

<p>The IEEE Signal Processing Society is sponsoring several networking and career development events at IEEE ICIP 2017, including the Women in Signal Processing Luncheon and the Young Professional Networking Night on Monday, September 18th, the Student Career Luncheon, the Ethics Discussion Sessions for Students and Volunteers, and the Associate Editor Best Practice Discussion on Tuesday, September 19th. </p>

<p>We would like to take this opportunity to thank all the volunteers, authors, sponsors, and participants for their support and contributions that help make ICIP 2017 successful! Special thanks to Sunny Niu, Haiying Xie and their team at the Zhihui Culture for providing support on a range of event services; Lance Cotton, Mike Simon and Billene Cannon of the Conference Management Services for providing support on paper handling and publications; and Caroline Johnson, Nicole Allen, and their colleagues at the IEEE and SPS providing assistance on a number of aspects.  We thank the strong support of the SPS leadership and Conference Board over the past five years, especially giving us this opportunity to host ICIP 2017 in Beijing, China.  Last but not the least, our sincere appreciation goes to the members of our organizing committee, including over a dozen in China as well as a number of members from many parts of the world working hard for many months and contributing to various aspects of the conference organization.  </p>

<p>Welcome to Beijing and enjoy ICIP 2017!</p>

<p>Xinggang Lin, Anthony Vetro, and Min Wu<br>
ICIP 2017 General Co-chairs</p>

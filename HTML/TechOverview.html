<div id="OverviewDiv">

Welcome to Beijing for the 24th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)!</p>

<p>This year ICIP received over 2000 manuscript submissions from authors around the world. The final technical program for the conference consists of 76 lecture sessions and 62 poster sessions, respectively, consisting of 915 papers accepted after the rigorous ICIP review process, plus 26 presentations of papers in ICIP's scope that have been accepted to the Signal Processing Society journals in the past year and not previously presented at a conference. The acceptance rate for the submitted papers is 45.3%. The accepted lecture and poster papers were subject to identical selection procedures and criteria. Scheduling of papers in lecture vs. poster sessions was done based on coherence and session size constraints with no regard to the review ratings. The reviews and decisions for the ICIP submissions were coordinated by the ICIP Technical Program Committee (TPC), consisting of 79 area chairs who are internationally recognized experts in image and video processing, 1222 reviewers, and the three of us as technical program chairs. Decisions on the ICIP 2017 submissions were finalized based on a total of 7630 reviews, an average of 3.72 reviews per submitted manuscript. Our sincere thanks go to all the area chairs and the reviewers. The ICIP Technical Program reflects your hard work and dedication, without which it would not have been possible.</p>

<p>In addition to regular oral and poster sessions, we include several features in the ICIP 2017 Technical Program:</p>

<p><b>Keynotes:</b> ICIP 2017 features three plenary speeches, thanks to the Plenary Chairs Yao Wang and Jiangtao Wen, on topics of high interest to our community. On Monday, Michael Elad, Professor of Computer Science at the Technion, will deliver a speech on “Sparse Modeling in Image Processing and Deep Learning.” Tuesday will feature Song-Chun Zhu, Professor of Statistics and Computer Science at UCLA, telling “A Tale of Three Families: Descriptive, Generative and Discriminative Models.” Finally on Wednesday, Kari Pulli, CTO at Meta, will present “Immersive Optical-See-Through Augmented Reality”.</p>

<p><b>Tutorials:</b> The ICIP 2017 Tutorial Chairs, John Apostolopoulos and Jiwu Huang, have put together a program of 7 selected tutorials that kick off the conference on Sunday.</p>

<p><b>Special Sessions:</b> The ICIP 2017 Special Sessions Chairs, Pascal Frossard and Feng Wu, have organized 7 special sessions following the established format for ICIP special sessions and they feature new and emerging areas within the ICIP scope.  Papers in the special sessions were subject to the same rigorous review process and acceptance rate as the regular ICIP program.</p>

<p><b>Demo Sessions:</b> The ICIP 2017 Demo Sessions Chairs, Qi Tian and Qionghai Dai, have organized a session of 10 demos that will showcase the latest research and development within the ICIP scope in an interactive and hands-on way.  </p>

<p><b>Industry Programs:</b> The ICIP 2017 Industry Chairs, Jian Lu, Debargha Mukherjee, and Lu Yu, have organized an extensive line-up of Industry Programs that consist of Industry Workshops, Grand Challenges, and Industry Keynotes and Panel Discussion. The Industry Workshops are organized by sponsoring companies (Netflix, Wolfram, MathWorks, and Google) on different topics. The Grand Challenges are competitions organized by various companies. The Industry Keynotes feature speakers from leading companies on innovative and large-scale applications of image and visual processing technologies, including
<ul>
	<li>“DuFace: large-scale face recognition”, by Dr. Yuanqing Lin, Baidu</li>
	<li>“VR & AR at Google: New Frontiers”, by Dr. Onur Guleryuz, Google</li>
	<li>“Rise of multimedia for social network”, by Dr. Xiaoyu Wang, Snap</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Lastly, the Industry Panel Discussion is moderated by Professor Wen Gao with a theme on the “Future of Compression for Visual Applications.”</p>

<p><b>VIP Cup:</b> Three finalist teams are judged in the first edition of the Video and Image Processing (VIP) Cup of the IEEE Signal Processing Society. This inaugural global undergraduate competition in visual signal processing area set the theme on traffic sign detection under challenging conditions.</p>

<p>To recognize research excellence, a number of paper awards will be awarded at the conference. Nominations were based on reviewers' scores and comments, and were recommended by TPC members. Nominated papers were evaluated by a large independent panel coordinated by the awards chair, Philip Chou. Please look forward to the announcement of the ICIP paper awards at ICIP 2017 Banquet.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the plenary speakers, panel moderators and members, tutorial presenters, reviewers, area chairs, session chairs, and all authors and presenters for their contributions to the ICIP 2017 Technical Program. Finally, we would like to convey our appreciation to Conference Management Services for the infrastructure they provided for the ICIP 2017 Technical Program, in particular, Lance Cotton, for his responsiveness to all our requests for updates, new features, and data processing.</p>

<p>Again, welcome to Beijing! Please look out for announcements of additional details of the ICIP program as these are updated on the ICIP website and on social media.</p>
